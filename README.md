**Intro to Programming I - Game Project**

## Oct 2022 - Mar 2023

## Associated with University of London

This project was part of my Midterm and Final. During Semester 1, I developed a platform game using JavaScript and the p5 library. The game featured a character named Chick, along with platforms, obstacles like canyons, enemies such as bombs, and a finishing line. I also designed the background scenery and integrated sound effects. Additionally, the game included lives and scores. As my first individual project, I was responsible for every aspect, from game design to coding and testing.
