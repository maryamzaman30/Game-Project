**Intro to Programming I - Game Project**

## Oct 2022 - Mar 2023

## Associated with University of London

This project was part of my Midterm and Final. During Semester 1. I developed a 2D platform game using JavaScript and the p5.js library, where I planned the storytelling aspect and designed the visual aesthetics to complement the narrative. The project demonstrates how core programming concepts can be applied in an engaging, problem-solving context. Aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice, the game features interactive elements like enemy bombs, canyons, scoring and lives, each reinforcing logic structures such as conditionals, loops and object-oriented design. From graphics to gameplay mechanics, I built every component independently, showcasing not only technical fluency but also creativity, user-centered thinking and the ability to translate abstract ideas into a compelling experience.
